# Algorithms
The main purpose of this repo is to be an educational tool. You probably shouldn't use these in production, instead, opting for the optimized versions of these algorithms that can be found else where. I will practice various categories of problems like graphs, search, dynamic programming, binary search, scaling, machine learning...etc
## IDE
I used Eclipse and PyCharm for Java and Python.
